### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Christopher Axe, I'm the Lead Application Engineer at Property49. I also freelance now and then.

I've experience on both frontend and backend development spending most of my time in fullstack. I've experience with everything from tools like WordPress & Shopify to frameworks like Raiils & Meteor. I work primarily in PHP and JS (NodeJS).
